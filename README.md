## Game Description
Indubio is a 2D top-down pixel art mystery game that blends investigative storytelling with bullet-hell combat mechanics. Players explore the world as Fern, a young apprentice investigator navigating a weekend gone wrong at a secluded house with friends. One of their friends was murdered! As players uncover clues, engage in emotional combat sequences, and interrogate suspects, they must piece together the truth, all while managing Fernâ€™s anxiety and self-doubt.

The combat system externalizes internal emotional battles, turning psychological struggles into visual metaphors the player must overcome. Every encounter has narrative weight, pushing players not only to solve the mystery of the murder but to explore their own emotional resilience in the face of fear, guilt, and doubt.

## More Information
Indubio was developed for our senior projects at the University of Florida over the course of the Spring 2025 semester.
