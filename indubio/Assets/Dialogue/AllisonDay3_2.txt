[NAME=Fern][SPEAKERSPRITE=Fern]So, you just slept through it? Do you have proof of this?
[NAME=Allison][SPEAKERSPRITE=Allison]Unfortunately no…
[NAME=Fern][SPEAKERSPRITE=Fern]Hm, okay. Well, I know this wasn’t a suicide or accident because there was no murder weapon in the room. 
[NAME=Fern][SPEAKERSPRITE=Fern]I found a knife in the wine cellar... which is very odd since the cellar was locked and the key seemed to be hidden...
[NAME=Allison][SPEAKERSPRITE=Allison]Where’d you find it?
[NAME=Fern][SPEAKERSPRITE=Fern]In a hidden corner of one of the kitchen cabinets. I found it while looking around the house.
[NAME=Allison][SPEAKERSPRITE=Allison]Oh wow, that’s interesting.
[NAME=Fern][SPEAKERSPRITE=Fern]I have one last question for you: I heard from Ashlyn and Olive that Devin was not treating your sister very well, which I had no idea about. Were you aware of this?
[NAME=Allison][SPEAKERSPRITE=Allison]...
[NAME=Allison][SPEAKERSPRITE=Allison]Oh…what? I had no idea, wow.
[NAME=Fern][SPEAKERSPRITE=Fern](<i>That…was a weird reaction. I need to have a group meeting about my findings.</i>)
