[NAME=Ashlyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Ashlyn]Maybe this will be helpful, I actually wrote a journal entry yesterday about our trip so far.
[NAME=Journal][SPEAKERSPRITE=Journal]“Dear Diary, my weekend trip with my friends has been going great so far! I love being able to spend quality time with my best friends, sister, and boyfriend all at once. :,) "
[NAME=Journal][SPEAKERSPRITE=Journal]"My boyfriend has been a little mean today unfortunately but we’re working through it, like all couples do."
[NAME=Journal][SPEAKERSPRITE=Journal]"I’m trying to get him to use nicer words towards me and I think we’re making progress so I’m optimistic things will go better for us soon. :)”
[NAME=Fern][SPEAKERSPRITE=Fern](<i>Interesting, I had no idea Devin wasn’t treating her well…</i>)
[NAME=Fern][SPEAKERSPRITE=Fern]So what were you doing at 2am last night? How did you find him?
[NAME=Ashlyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Ashlyn]I was asleep like any other normal person would be at that time. Here, you can check my Fitness Tracker’s sleep tracker at that time.
[NAME=Fitness Tracker][SPEAKERSPRITE=Fitness Tracker]“Ashlyn’s fitness tracker that she provided as evidence. It seems to prove she was asleep during the murder due to its sleep tracking feature.”
[NAME=Fern][SPEAKERSPRITE=Fern](<i>Hm, yeah the time matches up. She woke up at 2:38, and the scream was at 2:41. That’s not enough time for her to commit a murder and hide the murder weapon.</i>)
[NAME=Ashlyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Ashlyn]We had a little tiff yesterday evening and I wanted to go in his room to cuddle with him since I felt pretty bad about it. That’s when I walked in on him…
[NAME=Fern][SPEAKERSPRITE=Fern]I understand. Thank you for providing this evidence, it’s very helpful.
