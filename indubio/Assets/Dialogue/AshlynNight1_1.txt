[NAME=Ashlyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Ashlyn]No, no... who could have done this to him???
[NAME=Ashlyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Ashlyn]My beloved Devin...
[NAME=Fern][SPEAKERSPRITE=Fern](<i>Hm, looks like a stab wound. Why is there no weapon anywhere then? Couldn’t have been a suicide…</i>)
[NAME=Fern][SPEAKERSPRITE=Fern]I’m sorry this happened, Ashlyn. Unfortunately, this looks like a murder. To be safe, I think everyone should go stay in their rooms for the time being since we potentially have a murderer among us. I’ll help resolve this in the morning.
