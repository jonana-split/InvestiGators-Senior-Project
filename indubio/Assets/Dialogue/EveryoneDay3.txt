[LEVEL=1]
[NAME=Fern][SPEAKERSPRITE=Fern]Thank you all for meeting with me. I know this has been an insanely hard weekend for all of us with the loss of our friend, but I hope I can bring some closure to this situation.
[NAME=Fern][SPEAKERSPRITE=Fern]I have a piece of evidence I discovered that I need to ask you all about. (<i>Let me get it out of my bag</i>)
[NAME=Ashlyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Ashlyn]*gasps* Oh my god…that’s Devin’s knife.
[NAME=Olive][SPEAKERSPRITE=Olive]What?
[NAME=Ashlyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Ashlyn]He collected knives, that’s one of his knives. I didn’t know he brought one with him. So…did he do it?
[NAME=Fern][SPEAKERSPRITE=Fern]I doubt it, I found it very far from his room. It was in the wine cellar.
[NAME=Olive][SPEAKERSPRITE=Olive]This house has a wine cellar?
[NAME=Fern][SPEAKERSPRITE=Fern]Yes, but it’s hidden. You access it through a small door in a kitchen cabinet, and it was locked when we arrived. So it needed a key to open it.
[NAME=Ashlyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Ashlyn]Where’d you find the key?
[NAME=Fern][SPEAKERSPRITE=Fern]It was in a hidden compartment inside one of the kitchen cabinets. I don’t know how any of you would even know that was there.
[NAME=Ashlyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Ashlyn]Oh no... I-It couldn’t be…
[NAME=Ashlyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Ashlyn]I know who would know about that spot…
[NAME=Fern][SPEAKERSPRITE=Fern]Who?
[NAME=Allison][SPEAKERSPRITE=Allison]...
[NAME=Ashlyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Ashlyn]...
[NAME=Ashlyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Ashlyn]Well, this is our uncle's house. Allison and I grew up visiting here. I have memories of her hiding my toys there…
[NAME=Allison][SPEAKERSPRITE=Allison]...
[NAME=Fern][SPEAKERSPRITE=Fern]Allison?
[NAME=Allison][SPEAKERSPRITE=Allison]I-I…
[NAME=Allison][SPEAKERSPRITE=Allison]It was an accident…
