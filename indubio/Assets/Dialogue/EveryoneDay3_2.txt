[NAME=Ashlyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Ashlyn]…Wow. This is a lot to take in.
[NAME=Allison][SPEAKERSPRITE=Allison]I understand. I know you can never forgive me, but please believe me when I say I never wanted to do this. All I wanted was to protect you and it went way too far. I’m so, so sorry…
[NAME=Ashlyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Ashlyn]I'm going to need some time to process this...
[NAME=Ashlyn][SPEAKERSPRITE=Ashlyn]Thank you for trying to protect me… I knew he treated me poorly and I’d always make excuses for him... but this all feels so unreal.
[NAME=Fern][SPEAKERSPRITE=Fern]Thank you Alison for being honest. I know that’s an extremely hard thing to do, and I’m sorry that happened.
[NAME=Fern][SPEAKERSPRITE=Fern]Well, just in time, it seems the storm is clearing up. We can finally go home.
[NAME=Allison][SPEAKERSPRITE=Allison]I-Is something going to happen to me?
[NAME=Fern][SPEAKERSPRITE=Fern]I’ll need to tell my boss about the situation, especially since this was my first case on my own.
[NAME=Fern][SPEAKERSPRITE=Fern]I understand it was an accident, but he'll have to look over my investigation.
[NAME=Allison][SPEAKERSPRITE=Allison]T-thank you…
