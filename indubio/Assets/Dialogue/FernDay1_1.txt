[NAME=Fern][SPEAKERSPRITE=Fern](I hate to do this but I think I need to investigate Ashlyn first. Logically, she’s the first prime suspect since she found the body. But as my friend, I feel horrible investigating her right after her boyfriend was just murdered. I know my boss would want me to do the right thing here though… Ughhh.)
